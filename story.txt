Bob is cat. He lives with his owners at a house in Madison, Wisconsin. He is turning 5 years old today, and his owners are planning to give him a tiny party with the family. His owners are a married couple without any kids, and they took Bob when he was born. Bob is basically like the kid of the family.
One day, much to Bob's surprise, his owner's adopted a dog to be Bob's sibling. This dog was named Jeffery, and he was a cute puppy. Bob's owners started to give Jeffery more attention, and Bob started to feel jealous. Were they replacing Bob with another cuter kid. Bob started to feel left out.

At first, Bob was unsure what to do. Whenever Bob tried to approach his owners and do the trick that always made them laugh, they just petted him distractedly. However, it seemed to him that Jeffery could do the smallest thing, like fall over, and they would always have smiles on their faces. Eventually, Bob developed a dislike for Jeffery. Whenever Jeffery came over to Bob's little corner, Bob would hiss at him and tell him to go away. Bob's feelings were so confused, he didn't realize what he was doing. He just wanted Jeffery to be out of sight. Over the next few weeks, Bob stayed in his little corner more and more. He refused to do anything and just lay in his little bed.
